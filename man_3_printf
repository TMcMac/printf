.SH NAME
.B _printf \- a from scratch version of the classic printf function used to print a formated string.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"
.br
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
 A function to produce and output string including any formated output according to a formatted specifier.

.br
.B %
The percent symbol is our trigger char which lets our _printf function know that a format specifier is next and we will need to call a type matched function in order to properly add the formated data to our output string.

.br
.B c
%c is not for cookie, but instead for char, or a single character to be added to our string

.br
.B s
The %s specifier means that a string value or char * is the data expected so string concat will be needed to add the formatted information to our output string.

.br
.B i
The %i specifier indicated that an integer will be the data type to be added to our output string.

.br
.B d
The %d indicates that a decimal integer is the formatted data type to be added to our output string.

.br
.B Return Value
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed
(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH OPTIONS
None.
